# Understanding the Lifecycle Policies for Dynamics GP

Beginning with the October 2019 release, Microsoft Dynamics GP follows the Modern Policy. The Modern Policy offers continuous support and servicing, including bug fixes, new features and the latest tax updates. Customers may stay current by taking at least one of the three yearly planned Dynamics GP releases. Before the October 2019 release, any older release will continue to follow their existing Lifecycle timelines under the Fixed Policy. You can see those dates in the table below. We commit to 3 updates per year with additional updates as needed.  

## Understanding the Lifecycle Policies for Dynamics GP

In October 2019 Microsoft introduced the Modern Lifecycle Policy for Microsoft Dynamics GP. Before this date, the solution was governed by the Fixed Lifecycle Policy. The Modern Policy offers continuous support and servicing, including bug fixes, new features and the latest tax updates. Customers may stay current by taking at least one of the three yearly planned Dynamics GP releases. Before the October 2019 release, any older release will continue to follow their existing Lifecycle timelines under the Fixed Policy. You can see those dates in the table below.  

The following illustration shows the lifecycle of the various versions of Dynamics GP:

For more information about the lifecycle of the version of Dynamics GP that you are using, see [here](/lifecycle/products/?terms=Dynamics%20GP).  

## If your Dynamics GP solution is governed by Fixed Lifecycle

The following older versions of Dynamics GP are governed by the **Fixed Lifecycle Policy**:

| **Product** | **Mainstream support** | **Extended support** |
|--|--|--|
| Dynamics GP 2013 and GP 2013 R2 | Ended April 4, 2018 | Extended support ends April 11, 2023 |
| Dynamics GP 2015 and GP 2015 R2 | Ended April 14, 2020 | Extended support ends April 8, 2025 |
| Dynamics GP 2016 and GP 2016 R2 | Mainstream support ends July 13, 2021 | Extended support ends July 14, 2026 |
| Dynamics GP 2018 and GP 2018 R2 | Mainstream support ends January 10, 2023 | Extended support ends January 11, 2028 |

Installing any compatible Dynamics GP tax release or hotfix on Dynamics GP 2018 or Dynamics GP 2018 R2 will bring you to at least version 18.2 which enacts the Modern lifecycle policy. There are no tax releases or hotfixes available for Dynamics GP 2018 or Dynamics GP 2018 R2 that would allow you to stay on the fixed lifecycle.

## If your Dynamics GP solution is governed by Modern Lifecycle

The [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern) offers continues support and servicing, including bug fixes, new features, and latest tax updates. Under this policy, Dynamics GP customers stay current by taking at least one of the three yearly planned Dynamics GP updates. These updates will typically consist of a hotfix, tax, or regulatory update.

The update schedule for the three annual updates of Dynamics GP is typically released in June, October, and November/December as outlined in the following table.

|Milestone |Example date  |Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|June update|June 1 | Tax updates, regulatory updates, hotfixes        |
|October update|October 1 | Tax updates, regulatory updates, hotfixes        |
|December update|December 1 | Tax updates, regulatory updates, hotfixes        |
