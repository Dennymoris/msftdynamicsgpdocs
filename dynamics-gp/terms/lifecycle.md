# Understanding the Lifecycle Policies for Dynamics GP

In October 2019, Microsoft introduced the Modern Lifecycle Policy for Microsoft Dynamics GP. Before this date, the solution was governed by the Fixed Lifecycle Policy. The Modern Policy offers continuous support and servicing, including bug fixes, new features and the latest tax updates. Customers may stay current by taking at least one of the three yearly planned Dynamics GP releases.  

The following illustration shows the lifecycle of the various versions of Dynamics GP:

The [Lifecycle](/lifecycle/products/?terms=Dynamics%20GP) site shows key information about each version of Dynamics GP. The following sections provide direct links for each listed version.  

## If your Dynamics GP solution is governed by Fixed Lifecycle

The following older versions of Dynamics GP are governed by the **Fixed Lifecycle Policy**:

| **Product** | **Mainstream support** | **Extended support** |Lifecycle definition|
|--|--|--|-- |
| Dynamics GP 2013 and GP 2013 R2 | Ended April 4, 2018 | Ends April 11, 2023 |[Dynamics GP 2013](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2013)/[Dynamics GP 2013 R2](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2013-r2)|
| Dynamics GP 2015 and GP 2015 R2 | Ended April 14, 2020 | Ends April 8, 2025 |[Dynamics GP 2015](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2015)/[Dynamics GP 2015 R2](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2015-r2)|
| Dynamics GP 2016 and GP 2016 R2 | Mainstream support ends July 13, 2021 | Ends July 14, 2026 |[Dynamics GP 2016](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2016)/[Dynamics GP 2016 R2](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2016-r2)|
| Dynamics GP 2018 and GP 2018 R2 | Mainstream support ends January 10, 2023 | Ends January 11, 2028 |[Dynamics GP 2018](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2018)/[Dynamics GP 2018 R2](/lifecycle/products/dynamics-gp-2018-r2)|

Installing any compatible Dynamics GP tax release or hotfix on Dynamics GP 2018 or Dynamics GP 2018 R2 will bring you to version 18.2 or later, which enacts the Modern Lifecycle Policy. There are no tax releases or hotfixes available for Dynamics GP 2018 or Dynamics GP 2018 R2 that would allow you to stay on the fixed lifecycle.

## If your Dynamics GP solution is governed by Modern Lifecycle

The current version of Dynamics GP is governed by the Modern Lifecycle Policy. The [Modern Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/modern) offers support and servicing, including bug fixes, new features, and latest tax updates. Under this policy, Dynamics GP customers stay current by taking at least one of the three all-inclusive Dynamics GP updates, typically released in June, October, and December each year. The October update typically delivers new capabilities. The two other updates will typically consist of hotfixes, tax updates, and any relevant regulatory updates.

The following table outlines the release schedule for the three committed all-inclusive updates of Dynamics GP each year.

|Milestone |Example date  |Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|June update|June 1 | Tax updates, regulatory updates, hotfixes        |
|October update|October 1 | New capabilities, hotfixes        |
|December update|December 1 | Tax updates, regulatory updates, hotfixes        |
