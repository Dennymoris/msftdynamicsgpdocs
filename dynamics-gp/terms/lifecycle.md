# Software Lifecycle Policy for Microsoft Dynamics GP

Beginning with the October 2019 release, Microsoft Dynamics GP follows the Modern Policy. The Modern Policy offers continuous support and servicing, including bug fixes, new features and the latest tax updates. Customers may stay current by taking at least one of the three yearly planned Dynamics GP releases. Before the October 2019 release, any older release will continue to follow their existing Lifecycle timelines under the Fixed Policy. You can see those dates in the table below. We commit to 3 updates per year with additional updates as needed.  

Below is the planned update schedule for Microsoft Dynamics GP, beginning with the October 2019 release.
