## Services that are subject to professional support services fees

Services that go beyond the services that are listed in the "Typical support services" section are subject to professional support services fees. These fees include a one-hour minimum charge for SmartList Builder, Excel Report Builder, Navigation List Builder, and Drill Down Builder setup support. To obtain pricing for SmartList Builder, Excel Report Builder, Navigation List Builder, and Drill Down Builder customizations, contact [mbsprofessionalservices@microsoft.com](mailto:mbsprofessionalservices@microsoft.com).

Support engineers will try to create the customization that you request. However, some customizations cannot be created because of limitations in SmartList Builder, Excel Report Builder, Navigation List Builder, and Drill Down Builder or because of the way in which data is stored in the database tables. Additionally, some customizations may not meet your exact specifications because of these reasons.

> [!NOTE]
> We support SmartList Builder, Excel Report Builder, Navigation List Builder, and Drill Down Builder setups that are customized for use with Microsoft Dynamics GP and with dictionaries that integrate with Microsoft Dynamics GP such as Human Resources, Manufacturing, and Fixed Assets.
>
> We do not support the customization of third-party products, such as dictionaries, tables, and views. We do not support this because Microsoft may not be familiar with the third-party table structures.
