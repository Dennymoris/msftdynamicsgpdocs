Microsoft Dynamics GP Email Troubleshooting Guide

This document is meant to walk through most of the errors you may run into when emailing out of Microsoft Dynamics GP.  

The goal is to make everyone an emailing expert!  

This document can be leveraged with all email functionality in Microsoft Dynamics GP, from the old Standard Report Writer Statement emailing method, to Word Templates.

Notes:
Currently TLS 1.0 and Basic Authentication (no MFA) are required for Exchange and Workflow emailing within Microsoft Dynamics GP. 
We are aware of the changes that are coming to the supportability of TLS 1.0 and Basic Authentication within our other Microsoft applications.  
TLS 1.2 and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) functionality was included in the 18.3 update released.

All email issues can be safely split up into three sets of issues:

Items unique to MAPI
Issues unique to Exchange
Or those that both methods have in common. 

This is how the documentation is organized.  

Starting with MAPI, moving onto Exchange, and ending with the common errors. 

System Preferences can be found under Dynamics GP Tools -> Setup -> System -> System Preferences. 
(keep in mind this setting is stored in the DYNAMICS database and is system wide, so changing this setting will affect all users)
