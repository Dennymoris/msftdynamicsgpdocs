# Welcome to Dynamics GP!

Dynamics GP is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business.  

The PDF files that you may have seen for earlier versions of Dynamics GP contains symbols to indicate notes, tips, and warnings, for example. here on the Docs.microsoft.com site, such visual alerts are provided in other ways- So if you're looking for a lightbulb, then this is now a note, and warning triangles are replaced by warnings.
