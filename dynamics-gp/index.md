# Welcome to Dynamics GP!

Dynamics GP is a business management solution for small and mid-sized organizations that automates and streamlines business processes and helps you manage your business. Dynamics GP has a long history, and you can find information about functionality on the installation media for your version of Dynamics GP and on the [Dynamics GP Support and Services Blog](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/b/dynamicsgp). We have started moving some of the existing content to the Docs.microsoft.com site, and we will be adding more content here at the new location in the future.  

The PDF files that you may have seen for earlier versions of Dynamics GP contains symbols to indicate notes, tips, and warnings, for example. Here on the Docs.microsoft.com site, such visual alerts are provided in other ways. So if you're looking for a lightbulb, then this is now a note, and warning triangles are replaced by warnings.

## Additional resources

A number of resources are available to help in addition to this library.  

### Blog

Go to our [Dynamics GP Support and Services](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/b/dynamicsgp) blog and learn more about recent updates and tips and tricks.  

### Resource Page

The following page shows a list of resources that can help you find the information that you need:
[https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/GP/learning/documentation/system-requirements/dynamicsgpresource](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/GP/learning/documentation/system-requirements/dynamicsgpresource)

The page will be updated going forward as new links become available, while some of the target pages will be added to the Docs.microsoft.com site.  

### Knowledge Base

Available at [https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/search/Pages/resultskb.aspx), the knowledge base provides you with instant access to the same database our support engineers use. You can find answers to common questions, along with technical tips and performance recommendations.  

### eSupport

Available at [https://mbs.microsoft.com/support](https://mbs.microsoft.com/support/newstart.aspx), you can find different ways to get support, including requests that can be handled with e-mail. On average, the response time is nearly twice as fast as telephone support. Thatâ€™s a big benefit during the critical year-end season.  

### Community

Available at [https://community.dynamics.com/gp/](https://community.dynamics.com/gp/), the Dynamics GP community is where you can start a year-end discussion with other members of the Microsoft customer community, for example. This database provides you with the opportunity to exchange information with other customers, which is perfect for providing tips and answers to year-end questions.
