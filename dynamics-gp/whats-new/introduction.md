# Introduction

The What’s New document is your guide to enhancements in Microsoft Dynamics GP. We add enhancements based on feedback we receive from customers, as well as on market research. Your willingness to help us build better products makes this a more complete solution for small and medium-sized businesses, putting you in a better position to manage your organization successfully.

Some enhancements described in this documentation are optional and can be purchased through your Microsoft partner. If you currently have a license for one of these modules and have an active enhancement program, you automatically will receive the enhancements contained in that module.

This introduction is divided into the following sections:
