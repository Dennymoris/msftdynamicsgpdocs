# Print All Sales Documents

You now can select how you want Microsoft Dynamics GP to Print and E-mail Sales documents in the Print Sales Documents window.  There are now three options to choose from.  The new option available is called 'Print ALL Documents'.  You can mark both 'Send Documents in E-mail' and 'Print ALL Documents' and the system will E-mail every customer setup for E-mail and then print ALL documents whether emailed already or not. You can also select to 'Send Document in E-mail' only or 'Print Document' only.   And lastly, you can 'Print Document' and 'Send Document in E-mail' at the same time and Microsoft Dynamics GP will E-mail all customers setup for E-mail and then print out the remaining documents that are not setup for email. 
To open the Print Sales Documents window, go to the Transaction Menu point to Sales and click on Print Sales Documents. You will then need to select your Sales Document or range of Sales Documents to Print and E-mail.  In this window you will now see a new option called 'All documents'.  

In this window the new option called "Print All Documents, gives you the ability to tell Microsoft Dynamics GP when you want to actually print out all documents regardless if it was emailed or not.  When you select Email and Print All documents the system will E-mail every document it can, then print all documents included in the range regardless if emailed or not.   You can also select both 'Print Document' and 'Send Document in E-mail', and Microsoft Dynamics GP will email every document it can, then print all other documents not setup for email.  It will also be including print outs for those documents that could not be emailed during the run.
