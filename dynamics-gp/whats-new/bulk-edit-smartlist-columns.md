# Bulk-edit SmartList Columns

With the release of the Microsoft Dynamics GP Fall 2020 you now have the ability to mass edit the columns on a SmartList.

In order to see this new functionality you will need to start by opening SmartList (Microsoft Dynamics GP and click SmartList). You'll then navigate to the specific SmartList you want to edit, for example we will look at the default Sales, then choose Customers and then click on the Columns button:

When the Change Column Display window opens, you'll notice that there is a new column with checkboxes.

If you want to remove more than one column you can mark them, then click Remove.

Similarly, if you mark multiple columns and use the arrow buttons on the right you can reorder more than one column at a time.
