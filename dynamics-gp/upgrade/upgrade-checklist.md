# Upgrade checklist

You can upgrade to Dynamics GP 2018 and later from Dynamics GP 2016 Tax Round 2 or later or GP 2015 R2 (14.0.0725), GP 2013 Tax Round 2 (12.0.1826). If you're using an older release, contact the Dynamics GP Technical Support team.

## When to upgrade

Before upgrading, we recommend that you create a timetable of the entire upgrade process. This timetable can include the scheduling of a test upgrade, live upgrade, upgrade training, and implementation. Be sure that the scheduled time to upgrade takes place during a time that works best for all Dynamics GP users and for your information technology (IT) staff. You may not want to upgrade before processing payroll checks or closing a year.
