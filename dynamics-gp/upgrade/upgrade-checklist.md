# Upgrade checklist

You can upgrade to Dynamics GP 2018 and later from specific versions of Dynamics GP. For the supported upgrade paths, see [Upgrading to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2018](https://mbs.microsoft.com/customersource/northamerica/GP/support/hot-topics/HOT_TOPIC_MDGP2018Upgrade) (requires access to CustomerSource).  

## When to upgrade

Before upgrading, we recommend that you create a timetable of the entire upgrade process. This timetable can include the scheduling of a test upgrade, live upgrade, upgrade training, and implementation. Be sure that the scheduled time to upgrade takes place during a time that works best for all Dynamics GP users and for your information technology (IT) staff. You may not want to upgrade before processing payroll checks or closing a year.
