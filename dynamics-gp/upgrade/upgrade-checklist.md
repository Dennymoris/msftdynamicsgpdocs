## When to upgrade

Before upgrading, we recommend that you create a timetable of the entire upgrade process. This timetable can include the scheduling of a test upgrade, live upgrade, upgrade training, and implementation. Be sure that the scheduled time to upgrade takes place during a time that works best for all Microsoft Dynamics GP users and for your information technology (IT) staff. You may not want to upgrade before processing payroll checks or closing a year.
