# Glossary of Terms in the Distribution Area in Dynamics GP**Glossary**

#### Account alias

>   A “short name” for a posting account in the chart of accounts. If the
>   account format has a large number of segments, using aliases can speed data
>   entry.

#### Active customer

>   A customer with whom business is conducted on a regular basis.

#### Advanced picking

>   Allows you to group picking tickets by specific criteria, print bulk picking
>   tickets, print the customer item on the packing slip and invoice, and define
>   customer specific picking instructions that are printed on the picking
>   ticket.

#### Alert message

>   A message that appears when inappropriate, inadequate or unclear data or
>   instructions are issued, when data is not accessible or when a confirmation
>   is sought.

#### Alignment form

>   A document that ensures text will be properly aligned when documents are
>   printed.

#### Allocating

>   The process of reserving the item in inventory. The item remains in
>   inventory until fulfillment but isn’t available for sale.

#### Audit trail

>   A series of permanent records used to track a transaction to the point where
>   it was originally entered. The audit trail can be used to verify the
>   accuracy of financial statements by outside accountants or auditors.

#### Audit trail code

>   A series of alphanumeric characters providing a precise record of each
>   transaction and where it has been posted.

#### Available to promise

>   The quantity available for a customer on a specific day by calculating
>   on-hand inventory and transactions that increase or decrease inventory, such
>   as sales orders, inventory adjustments, and purchase orders.

#### Back order

>   Orders that you place without adequate quantities on hand. For example, if
>   you want to allocate five items from your inventory, but have only three on
>   hand, you can back order the remaining two.

#### Backing up

>   The process of storing data on a secondary medium, usually on diskettes or
>   magnetic tape, in order to minimize the difficulty of recovering from data
>   loss. Backups should be performed routinely.

#### Bank card

>   A type of credit card. Bank cards include ATM cards that when used by a
>   customer, funds are transferred directly into your bank account. Bank cards
>   also include cards issued by a bank based on a credit rating and typically
>   do not carry a credit limit. The bank that issued the card will see to it
>   that the seller receives payment. Payments received from these cards are
>   treated as check or cash payments.

#### Base unit of measure

>   The unit of measure that is common to all units of measure on a unit of
>   measure schedule. The base is the smallest unit of measure on the schedule.
>   For example, if a unit of measure schedule includes the following units of
>   measure: each, pair and dozen, each would be the base unit of measure.

>   used to conveniently group transactions, both for identification purposes
>   and to speed the posting process.

>   posting. If the batch approval option is being used, the ID of the user who
>   approved the batch and the approval date will appear on posting reports.

>   Values for both the number of transactions in a batch and the total currency
>   amount of the batch. As transactions are entered, the actual totals will be

>   the actual number and amount that was entered.

>   and invoices only.

#### Charge card

>   A type of credit card. Charge cards are issued by banks and authorize the

>   cards are treated as accounts receivable amounts because you must submit
>   them to the card companies for reimbursement. You must receive reimbursement

>   disbursing of cash.

>   bank cards or charge cards.
